  -Making good progress, need a new user action that fetches user by Id.
  -Got that, my form is also coming along,
  -now I need a post user action that will hit that shit when hit edit button.
  -I update user in my session loop, but I need to fetch the user from the users loop as well, two actions 
Stories need errors.
  -Mess
Stories need delete.
Stories need edit.
  -Not too bad, set the draft to the edit story, when you hit publish, instead of post do a patch. Done.
Stories show needs social media bar to go to the side

Bonus
  -User profile, where you can edit bio, lists stories written by the user under heading, "Your stories"
